# ![React + Mobx + TypeScript Example App](project-logo.png)

> ### React + Mobx + TypeScript codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld-example-apps) spec and API.

### [Demo](http://7anshuai.js.org/react-mobx-typescript-realworld-example-app/#/) [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

## Getting started

To get the frontend running locally:

- Clone this repo
- `yarn install` to install all req'd dependencies
- `yarn start` to start the local server (this project uses create-react-app)


### Making requests to the backend API

For convenience, we have a live API server running at https://conduit.productionready.io/api for the application to make requests against. You can view [the API spec here](https://github.com/GoThinkster/productionready/blob/master/api) which contains all routes & responses for the server.

The source code for the backend server (available for Node, Rails and Django) can be found in the [main RealWorld repo](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld).

If you want to change the API URL to a local server, simply edit `src/agent.js` and change `API_ROOT` to the local server's URL (i.e. `localhost:3000/api`)


## Functionality overview

The example application is a social blogging site (i.e. a Medium.com clone) called "Conduit". It uses a custom API for all requests, including authentication.

**General functionality:**

- Authenticate users via JWT (login/signup pages + logout button on settings page)
- CRU* users (sign up & settings page - no deleting required)
- CRUD Articles
- CR*D Comments on articles (no updating required)
- GET and display paginated lists of articles
- Favorite articles
- Follow other users

**The general page breakdown looks like this:**

- Home page (URL: /#/ )
    - List of tags
    - List of articles pulled from either Feed, Global, or by Tag
    - Pagination for list of articles
- Sign in/Sign up pages (URL: /#/login, /#/register )
    - Use JWT (store the token in localStorage)
- Settings page (URL: /#/settings )
- Editor page to create/edit articles (URL: /#/editor, /#/editor/article-slug-here )
- Article page (URL: /#/article/article-slug-here )
    - Delete article button (only shown to article's author)
    - Render markdown from server client side
    - Comments section at bottom of page
    - Delete comment button (only shown to comment's author)
- Profile page (URL: /#/@username, /#/@username/favorites )
    - Show basic user info
    - List of articles populated from author's created articles or author's favorited articles
